    <p>I am a writer, content creator, editor, and technical writer. The values of respect for the environment and dignity for all peoples permeate all my actions.</p>
    <p>In my usability (UX) work, I am driven by a desire to create environments that are useable by folks from all walks of life. If each person is unique, then no one can be totally normal. Therefore, instead of creating content in format that works extremely well for one group of people, I aim to create formats that can be adjusted to each person's unique needs. <img src="/BAwebsite/photos/Portrait_Bailey.jpg" style="width:150px" class="w3-right" alt="Portrait of BA"></p>

        <li>Edit PR stories in accordance with University and College policy</li>
        <li>Manage six writers per semester, editing all three of their stories (18-20 stories for me total) and ensuring they meet deadlines</li>
        <li>Act as a liaison between writers and senior editors, and between writers and their clients</li>
        <li>Maintain the website and create or reorganize web content upon request</li>

      </ul>
      <p class="w3-text-grey w3-large">*Backpack and CLAgency refer to the same organization. We underwent a rebranding and renaming while I worked there, transitioning from CLAgency, which was hard to pronounce for new clients, to Backpack, a name that was easier to pronounce but still conveyed our unique status as students.</p>
